# TaskBuddy

TaskBuddy is a task management application made by me using Firebase Cloud Firestore and other features from Firebase.

I'm proud of this project because it is my first JavaScript project with hundreds of lines of code.

Here is a link to the app: https://taskbuddymanager.netlify.app

Here are some screenshots:
