# TaskBuddy

TaskBuddy is a task management application made by me using Firebase Cloud Firestore and other features from Firebase.

I'm proud of this project because it is my first JavaScript project with hundreds of lines of code.

To log in, you can use Google or Facebook account.
For, now GitHub is not available.

You can use your email and password or if you don't have an account, create a new one using new email and password, then pressing CREATE ACCOUNT



Features in the app:

-Only the task's author can see it.

-Only the task's author can edit, delete, update, mark as done, and mark as undone the task

-Tasks are filtered by newest

-All information about tasks is stored in Firebase Cloud Firestore
